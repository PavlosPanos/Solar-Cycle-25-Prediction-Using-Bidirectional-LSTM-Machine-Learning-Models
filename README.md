# Solar Cycle Prediction with Bidirectional LSTM Models

## Introduction

This README file provides an overview of the work conducted to create several Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for predicting solar cycles based on solar sunspot data and cosmic radiation measurements. Solar cycle prediction is of great importance in understanding space weather and its potential impacts on Earth. The Bidirectional LSTM models were employed to leverage the sequential nature of the data and improve the accuracy of solar cycle predictions.

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to develop accurate and reliable models for predicting future solar cycles using historical solar sunspot data and cosmic radiation measurements. Solar cycles are complex, periodic variations in solar activity that impact space weather phenomena, including geomagnetic storms and radiation levels in space. Predicting these cycles can aid in space weather forecasting and mitigation strategies.

### Data Sources

The project relies on two main data sources:

1. **Solar Sunspot Data:** Historical records of sunspot counts on the Sun's surface. Sunspots are indicators of solar activity and are closely related to the solar cycle.

2. **Cosmic Radiation Measurements:** Data on cosmic radiation levels in space. Cosmic radiation is influenced by solar activity and can provide additional insights into the solar cycle.

### Approach

The project adopts a data-driven approach to predict solar cycles. The key steps include:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather historical solar sunspot data and cosmic radiation measurements. Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure it is suitable for training machine learning models.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the data that can help the models capture the underlying patterns of solar cycles.

3. **Model Selection:** Develop and evaluate several Bidirectional LSTM models with varying architectures and hyperparameters. Bidirectional LSTMs are chosen due to their ability to model temporal dependencies in sequential data.

4. **Model Training:** Train the selected models using historical data, with the aim of learning the patterns and characteristics of solar cycles.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Evaluate the models on both training and validation datasets to ensure they generalize well.

6. **Solar Cycle Prediction:** Once the models are trained and validated, use them to make predictions for future solar cycles.
